## Getting Started

This example allows the user to change the slider, press start, and watch the progress bar change its speed to the new time.
It is a great starting point for someone who wants to implement different levels in a game menu.

Example:
  30 seconds - hard level
  60 seconds - medium level
  120 seconds - easy level
